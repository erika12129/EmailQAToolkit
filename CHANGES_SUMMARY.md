## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Copyright Detection Pattern
**Location**: Line 356 in `email_qa_enhanced.py`
**Change**: Added `r'@(\d{4})'` pattern to copyright detection

**Before**:
```python
copyright_patterns = [
    r'©\s*(\d{4})',  # © 2025
    r'&copy;\s*(\d{4})',  # &copy; 2025
    # ... other patterns
]
```

**After**:
```python
copyright_patterns = [
    r'©\s*(\d{4})',  # © 2025
    r'@(\d{4})',  # @2025 (common email typo for copyright)
    r'&copy;\s*(\d{4})',  # &copy; 2025
    # ... other patterns
]
```

### 2. Copyright Validation Display
The copyright validation now displays as a regular metadata table row with:
- Field: "Copyright Year"
- Expected: "2025" 
- Actual: detected year (e.g., "2025")
- Status: "PASS" or "FAIL"

## Test Results
✓ Successfully detects "@2025" format in emails
✓ Successfully detects "©2025" format in emails  
✓ Displays as metadata table row (not in issues section)
✓ Shows clear PASS/FAIL status
